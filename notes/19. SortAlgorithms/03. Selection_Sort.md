## Selection Sort

repeatedly find the minimum and move it to sorted part

```python
def selectionSort(customList):
    for i in range(len(customList)):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(customList)):
            if customList[min_index] > customList[j]:
                min_index = j
        customList[i], customList[min_index] = customList[min_index], customList[i]
```
time complexity: O(n^2)

<br/>

When to use:
- insufficient memory (O(1))
- easy to implement

When to avoid:
- when time is a concern
