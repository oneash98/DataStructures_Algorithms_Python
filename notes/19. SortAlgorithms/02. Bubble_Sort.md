## Bubble Sort

repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent items -> swap if in wrong order

```python
def bubbleSort(customList):
    for i in range(len(customList) - 1):
        for j in range(len(customList) - i - 1):
            if customList[j] > customList[j + 1]:
                # 순서 바꾸기
                customList[j], customList[j + 1] = customList[j + 1], customList[j]
```
time complexity: O(n^2)

<br/>

When to use:
- input is already sorted
- space is a concern (O(1))
- easy to implement

When to avoid:
- time is a concern (poor time complexity)
