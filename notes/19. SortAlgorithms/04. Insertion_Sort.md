## Insertion Sort

take first element from unsorted array -> find correct position in sorted array -> repeat

```python
def insertionSort(customList):
    for i in range(1, len(customList)):
        key = customList[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < customList[j]:
            customList[j + 1] = customList[j]
            j -= 1
        customList[j + 1] = key
```
time complexity: O(n^2)

When to use:
- when space is a concern
- easy to implement
- when continuous inflow of numbers

When to avoid:
- when time is a concern
