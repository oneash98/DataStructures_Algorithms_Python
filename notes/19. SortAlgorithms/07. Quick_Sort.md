## Quick Sort

divide and conquer

find pivot number -> small numbers to left & bigger numbers to right

extra space not required

```python
def partition(customList, low, high):
    i = low - 1
    pivot = customList[high]
    for j in range(low, high):
        if customList[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            customList[i], customList[j] = customList[j], customList[i]
    customList[i + 1], customList[high] = customList[high], customList[i + 1] # pivot 왼쪽은 작은 수, 오른쪽은 큰 수가 되도록 이동
    return (i + 1)

def quickSort(customList, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(customList, low, high)
        quickSort(customList, low, pi - 1)
        quickSort(customList, pi + 1, high)
```
time complexity: O(nlogn)

space complexity: O(n)

<br/>

When to use:
- when average expected time is O(nlogn)

When to avoid:
- when space is a concern
- when stable sort needed
