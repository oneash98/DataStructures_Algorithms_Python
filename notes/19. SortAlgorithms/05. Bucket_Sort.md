## Bucket Sort

Create buckets & distribute elements -> Sort buckets individually -> merge buckets

```python
import math

def bucketSort(customList):
    numOfBuckets = round(math.sqrt(len(customList)))
    maxValue = max(customList)
    arr = []

    for i in range(numOfBuckets):
        arr.append([])
    
    for j in customList:
        index_b = math.ceil(j * numOfBucket / maxValue)
        arr[index_b - 1].append(j)

    for i in range(numOfBuckets):
        arr[i] = insertionSort(arr[i])

    k = 0
    for i in range(numOfBuckets):
        for j in range(len(arr[i])):
            customList[k] = arr[i][j]
            k += 1

    return customList
```
time complexity: O(n^2) (insertion sort)

space comlexity: O(n) (temporaray array를 생성)

When to use:
- when inputs are uniformly distributed (ex. 1,2,4,5,3,8,7,9)

When to avoid:
- when space is a concern
